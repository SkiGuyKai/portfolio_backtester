# portfolio_backtester
Simple program intended to backtest an optimized portfolio and compare it against common weighting schemes.

Meant to be used after my portfolio optimizer, this takes in a list of exchange-traded securities along with the associated weights. Outputs potential gains along with comparisons to other weights.
